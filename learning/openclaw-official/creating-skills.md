# Creating Skills

# Creating Skills

Skills teach the agent how and when to use tools. Each skill is a directory
containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions.

For how skills are loaded and prioritized, see [Skills](/tools/skills).

## Create your first skill

  Skills live in your workspace. Create a new folder: ```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}} mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/hello-world ```   Create `SKILL.md` inside that directory. The frontmatter defines metadata, and the markdown body contains instructions for the agent. ```markdown theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}} --- name: hello_world description: A simple skill that says hello. --- # Hello World Skill When the user asks for a greeting, use the `echo` tool to say "Hello from your custom skill!". ```   You can define custom tool schemas in the frontmatter or instruct the agent to use existing system tools (like `exec` or `browser`). Skills can also ship inside plugins alongside the tools they document.   Start a new session so OpenClaw picks up the skill: ```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}} # From chat /new # Or restart the gateway openclaw gateway restart ``` Verify the skill loaded: ```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}} openclaw skills list ```   Send a message that should trigger the skill: ```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}} openclaw agent --message "give me a greeting" ``` Or just chat with the agent and ask for a greeting.

## Skill metadata reference

The YAML frontmatter supports these fields:

| Field                               | Required | Description                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                              | Yes      | Unique identifier (snake\_case)             |
| `description`                       | Yes      | One-line description shown to the agent     |
| `metadata.openclaw.os`              | No       | OS filter (`["darwin"]`, `["linux"]`, etc.) |
| `metadata.openclaw.requires.bins`   | No       | Required binaries on PATH                   |
| `metadata.openclaw.requires.config` | No       | Required config keys                        |

## Best practices

* **Be concise** — instruct the model on *what* to do, not how to be an AI
* **Safety first** — if your skill uses `exec`, ensure prompts don't allow arbitrary command injection from untrusted input
* **Test locally** — use `openclaw agent --message "..."` to test before sharing
* **Use ClawHub** — browse and contribute skills at [ClawHub](https://clawhub.com)

## Where skills live

| Location                        | Precedence | Scope                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| `\/skills/` | Highest | Per-agent | | `~/.openclaw/skills/` | Medium | Shared (all agents) | | Bundled (shipped with OpenClaw) | Lowest | Global | | `skills.load.extraDirs` | Lowest | Custom shared folders | ## Related * [Skills reference](/tools/skills) — loading, precedence, and gating rules * [Skills config](/tools/skills-config) — `skills.*` config schema * [ClawHub](/tools/clawhub) — public skill registry * [Building Plugins](/plugins/building-plugins) — plugins can ship skills Built with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com).
